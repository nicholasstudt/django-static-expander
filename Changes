Revison history.

1.0.3 Mon Oct 19 21:06:28 CDT 2009:
 - Added no_recurse option and "as var_name" option to the
   dynamic_include template tag. (Contributed by Carson Gee) 
 - Added the ability for the page that is being included to be parsed as
   a template itself. This allows for template tags in the individual
   pages.

1.0.2:
 - Added try/except to deal with unmapped Unicode in path for dynamic
   includes.
