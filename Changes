 - Fixed version numbers to be <major>.<minor>[.<bugfix>]

 - Added no_recurse option and "as var_name" option to the
   dynamic_include template tag. (Contributed by Carson Gee) 
 - Added the ability for the page that is being included to be parsed as
   a template itself. This allows for template tags in the individual
   pages.
